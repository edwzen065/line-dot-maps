# line-dot-maps
Draw lines on a map or make a map with dots in it

data/rawPopulation.tif is a population file, but you can replace with any single band geotiff
convolution.ipynb takes data/rawPopulation.tif and crops + blurs it
drawDots.ipynb makes a map with dots filling it
drawLines.ipynb makes a map with lines filling it

I used .ipynb files but I didn't really do the thing that makes the .ipynb file useful. Oops
